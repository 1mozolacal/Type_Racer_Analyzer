## Enhancements
Some possible enhancements I might add if the demand is there. Open an issue to indicate interest.
- Upsert on data. In other words only pull missing data. Will making fetching your last couple of runs very fast
- Parsing data for each run. The text that you wrote, the speed for individual segments, etc.
- Have today use local timezone instead of UTC time
